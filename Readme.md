## Features:

* call a JSON api in HttpClient
* run a complex LINQ query with groups
* integration test
* add Rhino.mocks for mocking repository for service unit test
* layered architecture (model -> repository -> service)

 
## Enchancement
The code exercise is supposed to be simple so further enhancements can be
* more tests with failed consideration

## Notes
* the data displayed is a bit diffrent from the requirments as the json data file seems to be change already
